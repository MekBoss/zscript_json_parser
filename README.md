# Gzdoom Zscript JSON parser
JSON parser written entirely in Zscript.
Not exactly JSON, since it support comments, but it as JSON as possible

# But why?
Main point, to give modders ability to define and read custom variables in custom files.
It should prevent them from usage of some bad programming practices like global constants and/or variables, for example.

# How to use it?
If you really dont know what to do, here step by step guide
1. Examine "example.json" file to know language syntax specifics and how define your own variables.
2. Examine zscript.zc file to know how to get value of variables by its name.
3. Copy this library in you mod folder.
That should be enough.
